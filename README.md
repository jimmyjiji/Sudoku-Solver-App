# Sudoku-Solver-App
That Sudoku puzzle on the daily newspaper too tough for you to solve? Just take a picture have this app take care of the rest!

This is my project for the Winter of 2015. I plan on creating an application that is able to parse an image 
by taking a picture, read the current numbers on the sudoku grid and update it in the application. Then, using a backtracking
algorithm through recursion, it will systematically solve the sudoku puzzle for you. It will then display the solution.

Perhaps future updates will show you the process and the calculation it goes through through the UI.
